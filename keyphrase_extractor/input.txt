Automatic terminology extraction or automatic keyphrase extraction is a very useful subfield of natural language processing when it comes to synthesizing information from texts in concise terms. In this master's thesis, this problem is approached with a sequence labeling approach and using supervised deep learning techniques in specific domains, using bidirectional LTSM (Long short-term memory) neural networks and contextual word embeddings. A statistical significance study has been carried out to verify that the results presented in this work are significant. The final result in the F1 score in the Inspec dataset is 0.5730 slightly better than the higher result of the state of the art, in addition, it offers less dispersed results. Additionally in this work, the variation of samples in the training set is analyzed, a program to convert the datasets to a sequence labeling format needed for the final system is provided and there is an available sample program to test the keyphrase extractor in texts given by the user.
